# Calibration as a method for design

The code contained in this repository implements the ideas described in the paper "Computer model calibration as a method for
design". The central idea is to use the computer model calibration framework of Kennedy and O'Hagan 2001 to optimize a computer model with respect to performance targets which are treated as "desired observations" of the system.

This repository is used for research in this topic, and currently contains no files intended for public consumption.
